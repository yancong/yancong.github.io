	<p>Jamal A., a 36-year-old French, came from Atlanta to New York to fix some paperwork for his passport with the French Consulate a few months ago. He has nowhere to stay in New York, as he’s still waiting for the Consulate to process his documents. “At first it’s awkward, but it’s okay to sleep here, unless it’s cold,” Jamal said on Friday morning around 1 A.M. Next to him, two other homeless people have already fell asleep.</p>

		<p>It was 17 degree on the afternoon of Jan. 3, 2014, after the snowstorm hit New York City. Joseph, 57, stood outside Penn Station holding his sign and begging money from people walking in and out of the station. It was one of the coldest days this winter, but for Joseph, it was just another day in the cold.</p>
		<p>He woke up in Union Square under blankets and plastic bags in the morning, hid his stuff in the park and made his way to Penn Station. He got there around 3 p.m., and got about $10 till 5 p.m., which he said was not bad.</p>
		<p>He used to be a crane operator, but got laid-off due to the economy depression. He lost his home in Howard Beach in Hurricane Sandy. He had no family to turn for help.</p>
		<p>Joseph said, "I couldn't get along with my siblings. After my parents passed years ago, they were after the money they left. I wasn't interested in that kind of thing."</p>

		<h4>Bratt<br><span class="loc">at 116th St.</span></h4></div>

		<p>I saw Bratt S. when I got off a B train at 116th St. He was lying on his right side on the ground, wearing a pair of glasses, reading Lee Child’s Echo Burning, which he later told me was found on the sidewalk at 57th Street and 8th Avenue.</p>
<p>“I read a lot. I have a really active mind,” he said. “Despite my intelligence, I was unable to maintain employment.”</p>
<p>Bratt, 52, has been living in New York since 1985. He used to be a driver for a moving company, but lost his job, because he said he lacked the social skills to keep the job. After his savings ran out, he became homeless about two years ago.</p>
<p>“If you’re a single white male, there’s not much help you’re gonna get,” Bratt said. He’s not getting help from any organization. He gets by through the money people put in his cup when he sits on street corners reading books.</p>
<p>He’s not very interested in talking about himself, except telling me his dissatisfaction with Obama. In between the loud noises of trains passing by, he talked about Obamacare, running-gun in Benghazi and U.S. government debt.</p>
<p>Then he sat up, put down his book and took off his glasses. He looked to the exit of the subway station, as I photographed here. Then he said, “I got to move. There’s a cop coming.”</p>

		<p>After a cup of soup and a sandwich, he still felt hungry. He went back to the soup kitchen volunteers who were distributing food on 9th Avenue, only to find empty baskets and carts. He could do nothing but to accept the fact that the food were all gone.</p>
<p>He went back to Port Authority, where he stays day and night. He's homeless.</p>
<p>Outside Port Authority, he slowed down and picked up some cigarette butts from the ground. I asked him what are those for. He said, "I smoke them."</p>
<p>He asked me not to publish his real name, and made up a fake name, Tyron. He also doesn't want himself photographed. "Because I don't look good."</p>
<p>He's 43, from Rochester, NY. He usually sits somewhere in Port Authority and solicits money from passers-by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes I say, 'god bless you sir, god bless you ma'am.' Sometimes I beg, 'please, give me some money ma'am'. Sometimes I'm mad at some people, I'll get nasty. I'll go, 'f*** you'."</p>
<p>"Here is the catch-22 for me," he went on. "When I say 'god bless you', people don't give me that much. But when I beg, they stop and give me money. Some days when I beg people, I get more than $25."</p>
<p>For him, $25 for a day is a lot. He even did the calculation for me. "25 times 30, that's $750 a month. But I don't get $25 every day."</p>
<p>I asked him what he say to people the most.</p>
<p>He said it's "God bless you."</p>
<p>"Then you get less money," I asked.</p>
<p>He responded,"But my heart is at peace now."</p>

		<p >I visited the soup kitchen at St. Thomas Church on 5th Avenue and 53rd Street in December, 2013. The church's soup kitchen prepares food for people in need every Saturday, and distributes lunch bags in the street.</p>
<p >A volunteer at the soup kitchen called Danny told me, the soup kitchen started their mission since&nbsp;1984, and has never missed a single Saturday yet. Not even last year when Hurricane Sandy hit the city.</p>
<p >The volunteers at the soup kitchen prepared 315 lunch bags, and they went as far as 72nd Street and Columbus Avenue to give the lunch bags to those who were in need of a cup of warm soup.</p>

	<div class="name"><h4>Homeless Memorial Day Service<br><span class="loc">at New Song Church, Harlem</span> </h4></div>
	<div class="content"><img src="https://31.media.tumblr.com/38a3b9238fdca444083233871140f893/tumblr_inline_mz22laDYVw1svyfkn.jpg">
<p>About 50 people joined a memorial service in Harlem to remember homeless people who died in the past year in New York City on the afternoon of Dec. 21, 2013, the winter solstice and the longest night of the year.</p><p>
More than 50 names of people who died without a home were handwritten on a piece of paper on the wall of a room in New Song Church in Harlem, where the memorial took place.</p>
<p>"We are not numbers, we are persons," said Anthony Williams, the coordinator of the memorial service, in the opening speech.
The memorial service not only aimed to remember those people, but also to raise the awareness of the health impact of homelessness.
Life expectancy for chronically homeless people is around 45 years, according to the Center of Disease Control and Prevention, whereas the life expectancy for New Yorkers has increased to almost 81 years in 2013.</p>
<p>"We are talking about 30 or even 40 years of needlessly lost life because of homelessness. If we begin to put resources not into shelters, but into subsidy for people moving from shelter to real housing, we can prevent a lot of homelessness, and eventually end homelessness."</p>
